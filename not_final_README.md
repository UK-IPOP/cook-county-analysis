## Description

This project is designed to take the open-source dataset for the Chicago Medical Case Examiner's Notes ([here](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Public-Safety/Medical-Examiner-Case-Archive/cjeq-bs86)) and combine it with the openly available Chicago Land Use datasets ([here](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/data/land-use)) to analyze opioid death trends by Land Use area and geographic regions.

## API Reference

An API Reference for each module is available [here](https://uk-ipop.github.io/geocoding/).

## Requirements

This project assumes you are running on a unix environment and have:

| Software                            | Version |
| :---------------------------------- | :-----: |
| [Python](https://www.python.org)    |  >=3.8  |
| [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) | >= 1.0  |
| [R](https://www.r-project.org)      | >= 4.1  |

> \*Some package dependencies may break on ARM based processors (like 1 Macs) as support has not yet arrived. It is best to use a Linux-environment in these cases. Our pipeline is run using [Arch](https://archlinux.org).
> It is also required to have `make` and `unzip` installed, but these come pre-installed with most UNIX-based OSes.

## Installation

Getting this project up and running locally is a multi-step process. First, you can clone the git repository onto your local machine and change into that directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UK-IPOP/geocoding.git
cd geocoding
```

Then you can install the projects main dependencies:
`poetry install --no-dev` or install all dependencies (including development) using `poetry install`. Then activate the poetry created virtual environment by running `poetry shell`.

Now you're code environment is ready.

## Methodology

In order to perform this analysis, we ran the pipeline on 08-24-21 and used the resulting data-file for analysis in **[PAPER]**. To see an example of potential analysis that could result from this, see our [Tutorial Notebook](notebooks/Analysis_Tutorial.ipynb).

## Pipeline Explanation

The pipeline has multiple stages that need to run in succession.

1. Download the raw Land Use files and apply the Data Dictionary (extracted from [this PDF](resources/Chicago_LandUseClassifications_2015.pdf)) to each Land Use polygon to create new shapefiles.
2. Geocode the pharmacies provided by Cook County.
3. Download and geocode Case Archive records.
4. Calculate the distance to the closest pharmacy from each Case Archive record.
5. Spatially join the Land Use shapes to the Case Archive records giving each record a corresponding Land Use category.
6. Spatially join the Census Tract shapes to the Case Archive records.
7. Spatially join the Parks shapes to the Case Archive records identifying Park locations.
8. Extract drug names and classifications (i.e. fentanyl or non-fentanyl) from `primary_cause` and `secondarycause` fields in data.
9. Merge extracted drugs dataset into spatially-joined dataset for final output.
10. Cleanup dataset, add hotel/motel, hot/cold, death_date-related columns.
11. Cleanup files.

> \*These records will be geocoded which can take hours so it is recommended to pre-filter your data using the Cook County Open Data explorer and then modify the pipeline as needed if you do not require **all** of the records.

### Pipeline Flowchart

## Pipeline Usage

Running the pipeline is simple once you have everything setup.

Inside the home directory of the geocoding project simply run: `make pipeline`

This can take up to 10 hours depending on the system you are running and the number of ME records you are geocoding.

If you wish to remove any steps from the pipeline those lines can simply be removed from the `Makefile`

Additionally, sometimes the pipeline may stall (ArcGIS sometimes times-out) at which point you can simply resume running the commands sequentially found in the `Makefile`. Each command takes roughly 5-10 minutes _at most_, with the exception of the Case Archives geocoding which takes a few hours.

## Pipeline Improvements & Contributing

Currently, there are two main problems with the pipeline:

1. It requires two languages to run.
2. Some processes take a _very_ long time.

The first of these can be solved simply my migrating the singular R script into a Python script.

The second is an issue of performance and comes down to two main culprits. The first is the geocoding of the case archives and the pharmacies. This is limited by web requests to the ArcGIS geocoding service. Asynchronous support proved useful to speed up this process and provided a 40% reduction in speed, but the 50,000+ web requests still takes a few hours to complete on the ArcGIS server. The second culprit is the distance calculation which runs on all of the case_archives and all of the pharmacies. This ends up being almost 100 million iterations and is CPU limited. Multiprocessing could speed up this process.

## Data Dictionary

This table shows the columns that we add for analytical purposes and their definitions. You can see the Land Use data labels [here](.data/landuse_data_dictionary.csv) and the Case Archives [here](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Public-Safety/Medical-Examiner-Case-Archive/cjeq-bs86) under 'Columns in this Dataset'.

### New Columns

This has been moved to an [online spreadsheet](https://luky-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/nan231_uky_edu/_layouts/15/doc2.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B69f2b7ae-0a13-489c-9763-7938f79863f5%7D&action=editnew&cid=38c54ee7-cc51-4784-a7a4-5e010c9810e4) (for now). A markdown table will be generated and inserted below before pushing this file to GitHub.

In addition to this the new file has various columns regarding the Land Use categories which are self-explanatory and come from the above-mentioned dataset and [this PDF](./resources/Chicago_LandUseClassifications_2015.pdf).

Following those columns, there are **MANY** columns for drug extractions. These columns all have one pattern, each drug has two columns. One with the suffix "\_primary" which means the value (True/False -- 1/0 -- 9 for not searchable) was extracted from the `primarycause` column, while the one with the "\_secondary" suffix was extracted from the `primarycause_linea, primarycause_lineb, primarycause_linec, secondarycause` columns. Additionally, each selected drug belongs to specific categories and those categories are added and labeled (primary vs. secondary) for each record as well. For a table of drugs, search terms, and categorization, checkout our [drug dictionary](data/drug_dictionary.csv) file.
