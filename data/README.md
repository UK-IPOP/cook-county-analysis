# Data Folder

This folder houses two datafiles, one is `geocoded_medical_centers.csv` which is the results of our `scrape` and `geocode` programs.
This is provided as a convenience for those who do not want to run the programs themselves. The second file is `records_with_spatial_data.csv`
which is the result of all of the programs encompassed in this repo including `scrape`, `geocode`, `calculate`, and `spatial_join`. This is also provided
as a convenience for those who do not want to run the programs themselves, but due to its size requires GitHub LFS (large file storage) usage.
