## Description

This project is designed to take the open-source dataset for the Chicago Medical Case Examiner's Notes
(here) and combine it with the openly available Chicago Land Use datasets (here) to analyze opioid death
trends by Land Use area and geographic regions.

## Requirements

This project assumes you are running on a unix environment and have:

```
Software Version
Python >=3.
Poetry >= 1.
ArcGIS Desktop Any
```

```
It is also required to have make and unzip installed, but these come pre-installed with most UNIX-
based OSes.
```

## Installation

Getting this project up and running locally is a simple process. First, you can clone the git repository onto
your local machine and change into that directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/UK-IPOP/geocoding.git
cd geocoding
```

Then you can install the projects main dependencies: poetry install --no-dev or install all
dependencies (including development) using poetry install. Then activate the poetry created virtual
environment by running poetry shell.

Now you're environment is ready.

## Methodology

In order to perform this analysis, we ran the pipeline on [DATE] and used the resulting data-file for analysis
in [PAPER]. To see an example of potential analysis that could result from this, see our Tutorial Notebook.

## Pipeline Explanation

The pipeline has multiple stages that need to run in succession.

```
. Download the raw Land Use files and apply the Data Dictionary (extracted from this PDF) to each
Land Use polygon to create new shapefiles.
. Geocode the pharmacies provided by Cook County.
. Download and geocode Case Archive records.
. Calculate the distance to the closest pharmacy from each Case Archive record.
. Spatially join the Land Use shapes to the Case Archive records giving each record a corresponding
Land Use category.
. Spatially join the Census Tract shapes to the Case Archive records.
. Spatially join the Parks shapes to the Case Archive records identifying Park locations.
. Extract drug names and classifications (i.e. fentanyl or non-fentanyl) from primary_cause and
secondarycause fields in data.
. Merge extracted drugs dataset into spatially-joined dataset for final output.
. Cleanup dataset, add hotel/motel, hot/cold, death_date-related columns.
```

```
*These records will be geocoded which can take hours so it is recommended to pre-filter your data
using the Cook County Open Data explorer and then modify the pipeline as needed if you do not
require all of the records.
```

### Pipeline Flowchart

## Pipeline Usage

Running the pipeline is a multi-step process.

Inside the home directory of the geocoding project you can run the following commands:

```
./scripts/run_geo.sh
```

```
This command will download the case records and geocode the records that do not have
latitude/longitude provided by the medical examiner's office.
It will then run the golang program to calculate the distance to the nearest pharmacy from each
case record.
You will then need to take the output of the above command (which is the the
data/processed/cases_with_distances.csv) file and load it into ArcGIS for geo-spatial
analysis.
Inside ArcGIS load the datafile as XY points and then we utilize spatial joins with the LandUse
shapefile, census tract shapefile, and park shapefile.
Take the final spatially joined dataset/table and output it as a csv. Rename it and place it in
"data/processed/spatially_joined_records.csv.
poetry run python scripts/postprocess.py
This command cleans the data and creates some calculated fields.
./scripts/run_drugs_and_format.sh
This command uses our drug extraction tool to extract drugs from the combined_primary
and secondarycause fields.
It then transposes the drug output file and joins it to the cleaned cases.
Final results in data/output/finalized.csv
```

## Data Dictionary

This table shows the columns that we add for analytical purposes and their definitions. You can see the
Land Use data labels here and the Case Archives here under 'Columns in this Dataset'.

In addition to this the new file has various columns regarding the Land Use categories which are self-
explanatory and come from the above-mentioned dataset and this PDF.

Following those columns, there are MANY columns for drug extractions. These columns all have one
pattern, each drug has two columns. One with the suffix "\_primary" which means the value (True/False --
1/0 -- 9 for not searchable) was extracted from the primarycause column, while the one with the
"\_secondary" suffix was extracted from the primarycause_linea, primarycause_lineb,
primarycause_linec, secondarycause columns. Additionally, each selected drug belongs to specific
categories and those categories are added and labeled (primary vs. secondary) for each record as well. For
a table of drugs, search terms, and categorization, checkout our drug dictionary file.
